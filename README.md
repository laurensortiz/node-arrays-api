- Result =  Random Cat Fact

## Assumptions

1.  Read 2 JSON files from the file system(a.json, b.json) containing an array of
numbers, e.g. [1,2,3,4,5] and [6,7,8,9,10].  Display the result of summing the 
parallel elements.  The example would return [7,9,11,13,15].  

2.  Read a file from the file system containing an array of numbers, a.json.  Sum 
the elements in the array.  If the result is even, read another file from the file 
system containing an array of numbers, b.json, and print only the even numbers.  If 
the result is odd, read another file from the file system containing an array of 
numbers, c.json, and print the sum of the odd numbers.

3.  Pick a public API, twitter, google maps, etc 
(see http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory for more).  Write a program 
that exercises this api in an interesting way.  Note: it is preferred that you pick 
something where getting auth credentials is trivial.  Please provide instructions in 
the readme.
